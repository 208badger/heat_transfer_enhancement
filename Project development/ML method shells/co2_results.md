|model | mean absolute error | mean squared error (if available)|
|------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
|OLS linear regression | 14.9 | 493.8 |
|Random forest | 4.1 | 102.6 |
|Linear tensorflow | 14.2 | N/A |
|DNN tensorflow | 6.1 | N/A |

These results show that for the carbon dioxide emission data set the Random Forest model is actually the most accurate. This may well be different for our actual data.
DNN is not far behind mind. 

Pretty cool huh?
