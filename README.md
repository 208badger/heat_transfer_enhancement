# heat_transfer_enhancement
A short initial description for the project before I write a proper one: Investigation into what factors affect the heat transfer enhancement factor of pulsating flows in an exhaust manifold.

A few best practice notes for the repository:
- If one is to make changes, create a new branch, name it something recognisable, commit changes to that branch and then merge into the `main` branch.
- Try not to make changes to the `main` branch or git history.
